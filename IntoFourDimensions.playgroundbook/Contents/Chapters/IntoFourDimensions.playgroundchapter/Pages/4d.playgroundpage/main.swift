## The 4D hypercube - Tesseract

- Note:
 The construction of Schlegel diagram is not based on a specific (conventional) projection. You can pick a point on any surface of a 4‚É£Ô∏è-dimensional polyhedron, pull it out a little bit, and project it from there. If you want to know more about Tesseract, check out [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract)

/*:
 
- Important:
In geometry üîç, a *hypercube* is a cube higher than 3‚É£Ô∏è dimensions, and in 4Ô∏è‚É£ dimensions there is a hypercube called *Tesseract*, which has 16 points and 32 edges.

### About

* Callout(How I implemented this):
Similar to the 3D cube, I projection the 4‚É£Ô∏è-dimensional *Tesseract* into the SceneKit. If there is no projection method, you will not see the *Tesseract*, because human beings are living in 3Ô∏è‚É£ dimensions and cannot see üôà the 4Ô∏è‚É£-dimensional *Tesseract* directly.
Again, run üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è my code and adjust üîß the axis of rotation. There's a lot of math involved in matrix operations, too.
 \
 \
 Similar to the previous page, A 4Ô∏è‚É£D vector looks like this
 ![4dvector](4dvector.png)
 \
 \
 Same way as the previous page, in each frame, I update the Œ∏ this way(angle is very small)
 ![Œ∏](Œ∏.png)
 \
 \
 But we rotate two axis at a time, XY or ZW, thus the 4Ô∏è‚É£D *Rotation Matrix* looks like this
 \
 \
 ![4DRotationMatrix](4DRotationMatrix.png)
 \
 \
 And I update every 4D vector in each frame.
