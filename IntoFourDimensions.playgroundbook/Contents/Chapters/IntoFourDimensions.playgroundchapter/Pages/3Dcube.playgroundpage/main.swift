 3Ô∏è‚É£-dimensional creatures: How we see a 3D object on screen üñ•
 \
 \
 We humans are all 3‚É£Ô∏è-dimensional creatures, and I don't have to explain too much. In order to explore the 4‚É£Ô∏è-dimensional cube in the next page, I need to explain how you see a 3‚É£Ô∏èD cube.
 \
 \
 A 3‚É£Ô∏è-dimensional cube is displayed on a 2Ô∏è‚É£-dimensional screen. The process of showing it reduces 1Ô∏è‚É£ dimension. There are two ways of showing it. One is *slide method*, which is the trace left by an n-dimensional object passing through the space of n-1 dimension. Another the way is called *projection*, and it‚Äôs the way how screen display things. I chose the latter one.
 
 Run üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è my code. See ü§î how the 3Ô∏è‚É£D cube rendered into 2Ô∏è‚É£D, and try to adjust üîß the axis of the rotation.

 ### About
 * Callout(How I implemented this):
 I don't have to go into too much theory about how *projection* approach reduces the dimensions and render stuff.
 But I need to mention how I did it. You may notice that I use SpriteKit, which is a 2Ô∏è‚É£-dimensional framework, but I rendered 3‚É£Ô∏è-dimensional cube and they were computed in real time ‚è≥.
 \
 A 3D vector looks like this

 \
 \
 The key üîë is to use *Rotation Matrix*
 \
 \
 A 3D *Rotation Matrix* looks like this
 \
 \
 ![3DRotationMatrix](3DRotationMatrix.png)
 \
 \
 In each frame, I update the Œ∏ this way(angle is very small)
 ![Œ∏](Œ∏.png)
 \
 \
 And I update every 3D vector in each frame(There are 8 vectors in a 3D cube, because it has 8 points).
 \

 There's a lot of math involved in matrix operations. If you want to know more, check out [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix)
