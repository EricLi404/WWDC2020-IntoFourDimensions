 ## Welcome. Ready. Set. And Into Four Dimensions
 
 Welcome to my playgroundbook, let me show you the magic of code. I will use it to create a 2️⃣ to 3️⃣ to 4️⃣ dimensional world 🌏 for you. With the help of powerful SpriteKit, SceneKit and ARKit, it will be a wonderful exploration beyond your imagination🧠.
 
 - Note:
 Through the evolution dimensions, some conjectures about 4️⃣-dimensional space have been put forward. Although these conjectures can’t be proved to be true now, many scientific theories 🔬 begin with conjectures. Today's scientific theory is generally based on the summarization of the rules of the phenomenon, but there is not enough accurate understanding of the phenomenon of the 4️⃣-dimensional space, or to see the phenomenon without thinking that it is caused by the 4️⃣-dimensional space.
 
 - Important:
 4️⃣-dimensional space is different from 3️⃣-dimensional one, which refers to the standard *Euclidean space*. Human beings as 3️⃣ -dimensional creatures can understand 4️⃣ dimensions as space with time ⏲, but can't exist in 4️⃣-dimensional space and understand it🙅🏻‍♂️, because human beings belong to the 3️⃣-dimensional space.
